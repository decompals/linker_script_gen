# Vram classes

Vram classes aim to help reduce duplicated data across the segments and more
clearly organize the memory layout.

A vram class specifies a place in memory, which may be described in a somewhat
complex way, so one or more segments can point to this class instead of try to
describe the memory layout on the segment itself.
